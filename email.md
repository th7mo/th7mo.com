# Email

I use my own custom domain `th7mo.com` for my emails.
The [Stalwart](/stalwart.md) note describes how I manage my email server.
I use the following email addresses:

- `dev@th7mo.com`
- `thimo@th7mo.com`, 
- `void@th7mo.com`, this is public and can be used for shopping and spam.

Legacy addresses:

- `work@th7mo.com`, currently used for only LinkedIn.
- `gaming@th7mo.com`, currently used for gaming platforms (League, Blizzard, Xbox, Parsec, Steam)
- `media@th7mo.com`, currently used for media platforms (Spotify, Tidal, Discord, Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit)

## New situation - Yet to implement

> [!NOTE]
> The new situation still needs to be implemented.
> This is not done yet.
> 
> - The old situation needs to be removed.
> - Also, the YouTube Premium mail needs to be migrated to `thimo@th7mo.com`
>
> When the migration is done all references to the old situation will be removed in this note.
> Only the explanation for why the new implementation is the best one will remain.

### Design philosophy

Excessive categorizing is doing me more harm than good.
Setting up the emails on a new email client takes a lot of time and I doubt a lot which email to use for some accounts.
I am using a unique password for each account, so separating really important stuff from regular stuff is secure enough for me.
I handle and archive each email on each account, so there is no real difference from separate emails.
There is no real difference from separate emails since I handled and archived each email on each account anyway. 

### root@th7mo.com 

This email is for everything administrative (except regular subscriptions). 

### thimo@th7mo.com

This email is for anything public. 
Probably the most accounts will be using this email address.
Merges `media@th7mo.com`, `dev@th7mo.com`, `work@th7mo.com`, `gaming@th7mo.com` and old `thimo@th7mo.com` public stuff.

### thimoquinten@gmail.com

For throw-away stuff and spam I never use.
Migrates old `void@th7mo.com` accounts.
A fallback for when my other emails are compromised.
