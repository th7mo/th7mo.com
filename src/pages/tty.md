When a Linux desktop environment does not work, Linux falls back to the
TTY. The TTY is a terminal emulator and can be used as fallback to
troubleshoot the system. It is also the only way to operate with the
system during and after installing minimal distributions like Gentoo or
Arch.

## Troubleshooting

It can happen that a system or desktop environment is unusable. To open
a TTY anywhere use the [Ctrl]{.kbd} + [Alt]{.kbd} + [Fn\[1-6\]]{.kbd}
combination.

The TTY can be used as any other terminal emulator.
