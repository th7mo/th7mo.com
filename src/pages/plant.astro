<h1>Plant</h1>
<p>
  The <a href="digital-garden.html">digital garden</a> is composed of plants.
  A plant represents a <em>single</em> idea, and should be split up if it contains more.
  This makes plants <a href="atomic">atomic</a>.
  Plants can <a href="link-(html).html">link</a> to other plants.
</p>
<p>Plants undergo three phases of maturity:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="seedling"><em>seedlings</em> are very rough and new ideas.</li>
  <li class="budding"><em>buddings</em> are clarified and stable ideas.</li>
  <li class="evergreen"><em>evergreens</em> are completed and established ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Although evergreens are 'completed', plants always require some pruning now and then.
  No plant is ever completely finished and always grows.
</p>
<p>A plant's current phase of maturity is indicated with an icon at the navigation on top of the page.</p>

<h2>Naming</h2>
Ideally, a name for a plant should be one word.
If a name could represent multiple things, a disambiguation qualifier surrounded by <code>(</code> parentheses
<code>)</code> must be added.
For example, Mercury can refer to a chemical element and a planet.
To distinguish the two, they can be named <code>Mercury (element)</code> and <code>Mercury (planet)</code>.
