<!-- TODO: The implementation for symlinking might be replaced with a `--bare` repository using a worktree implementation. -->
<p>
  Files prefixed with a dot <code>.</code> are called dotfiles.
  They are hidden by default on <a href="unix.html">Unix</a>-based operating systems.
  Dotfiles are used to store any type of configuration.
  All the user configuration is stored in dotfiles somewhere in or under the 
  <a href="home-directory.html">home directory</a>.
  A lot of applications store their configuration in the <code>~/.config/</code> directory.
</p>
<p>
  It is a good idea to make a <a href="git.html">Git</a> repository to back up and sync configuration files.
  However, it is not recommended to make a Git repository directly in the home directory.
  A better alternative is to move configuration files into a separate directory like <code>~/dotfiles/</code>.
  To make sure installed programs still have access to the configuration files,
  <a href="symbolic-link.html">symbolic-links</a> to the configuration files
  can be made using <a href="stow.html">Stow</a>.
</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>
  That dotfiles are invisible was an accident<sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup>.
  A long time ago Unix decided to hide the <code>.</code> and <code>..</code> directories because they exist in every directory.
  They only checked if the first character of the file (or directory) name was a dot <code>.</code>, and hid it when that was the case:
</p>
<pre><code is:raw>if fileName[0] == "." {
    hideFile()
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  This results in every file starting with a dot to be hidden.
  What they should have done is check if the filename is <code>.</code> or <code>..</code> instead:
</p>
<pre><code is:raw>if fileName == "." || fileName == ".." {
    hideFile()
}
</code></pre>
