description: "The smallest basic block of matter"

When something is atomic, it cannot be broken into smaller pieces.
Atomic things only have a [single responsibility](single-responsibilty-principe).
Atoms are the smallest unit of matter and cannot be further divided.

A book that uses this terminology is [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits).
