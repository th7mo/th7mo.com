A regular expression (or regex) is a match pattern. They allow
searching large amounts of text or making sure strings meet specific
criteria. This is useful for checking if passwords contain lowercase,
uppercase, and a few special characters. It can also be used to validate
if a string is a valid [email address](email-address).

Regular expressions are one of the few exceptions for commenting code.
This is because it can be difficult to understand a regular expression.

A regular expression can have special characters that have a special
meaning. The backslash `\` is used to escape a special character.
